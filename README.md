# Back-end Task for Financial Movements
You need to implement a backend application that would allow users to transfer funds between wallets. <br>
On every transaction, the system will need to take a commission of 1.5%.<br>

## Requirements:
- Create a relational database schema;
- Upon application start, the database should be populated with sample data (e.g several wallets that can be used to transfer funds between);
- The system should support ETH cryptocurrency;
- Create a REST endpoint that can be used to transfer funds;
- Provide a docker-compose.yml that can be used to run your solution by just doing docker-compose up;


Implement the solution as you would do it in real life and please feel free to fill the functional requirements gaps. <br>
If there are certain architectural decisions, limitations that you have intentionally done in your solution,<br> 
please feel free to elaborate on that in the README file.<br>

## Frameworks and tools
Node JS as a backend, and PostgreSQL as a database would be fittable for this implementation.<br>
You can also use any additional tools, besides mentioned above, that you think will serve the best <br>
for the problem at hand. Unit testing is also welcome.

## Time limit
The assignment has been intentionally designed not to take much of your time, please try to complete it in several hours.
